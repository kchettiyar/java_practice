	// Non-Primitive Data Structure Category
	// Linear and Non-Linear Data Structure 
	
	// Linear Data Structure Types
	// Arrays, Linked List, Stack and Queue
	
	// Non-Linear Data Structure Types
	// Tress and Graphs

	// These operation can be performed in DS
	// Insertion, Update, Deletion, Display, Sort, Search, Merge and Traverse
	
	// Data Structure Points
	// In computer science, a DS is a particular way of storing and organzing data in computer
	//		so that it can be used efficiently.
	
	// A DS is an arrangement of data in a computer's memory or even dist storage
	
	// An example of several common DS are arrays, linked list, queues, stacks, binary tree, hash tables
	
	// Different kinds of DS are suited to different kinds of applications, and 
	//		some are highly specialized to specific tasks
	
	// For examples, B-trees are particularly well suited for implementation of databases 
	//		while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.
	
	// DS are used in almost every pragram or software system
	
	// Specific DS are essential ingredients of many efficient algorithms, and make possible
	//		the management of huge amounts of data, such as large databases and internet indexing services.

	// Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize DS, rather than algorithms,
	//		as the key organizing factor in software design
	
	// A program is said to be efficient when it executes in minimum time and within minimum memory space
	
	// In order to write efficient programs we need to apply certain data management
	
	// DS are widely applied in following areas:- 
	//		Compiler Design, Operating System, Graphics, database app, Statistical analysis and package
	//		Numerical analysis, Simulation, Artificial Intelligence
	
	
	// Types of DS
